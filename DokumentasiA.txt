Java, a software platform and computer programming language, is one of the most pervasive technologies in the modern world.

Java is commonly used to refer to the Java platform, a set of tools allowing for easy cross-platform application development, as well as the Java programming language, which is a general-purpose programming language often used to develop programs for this platform.

The important thing about Java that differentiates it from many other technologies is that it is designed such that code written in Java can be run on any system that a Java virtual machine (JVM) can run on. This concept of write once, run anywhere was used as a slogan to promote Java’s cross-platform abilities. Java environments can be found on all sorts of devices, large and small, and therefore a Java developer has more flexibility when it comes to being able to treat code as agnostic to the system on which it runs.

The Java programming language itself is an object-oriented language, which is syntactically similar to C++. Unlike some other languages which came before it, which implemented classes but did not require their use, Java programs are always designed with an object-oriented design.

While the Java language and the Java virtual machine which runs Java code are closely paired, the two are separate. Code from other languages which is designed specifically for the JVM, like Groovy and Scala, can also run on the Java virtual machine.

Be careful not to confuse Java with JavaScript. While both languages are now found in numerous environments, JavaScript, which is most commonly used to power interactivity inside of a web browser, is a different tool completely. Other than a part of the name, the two don’t share much in common.
